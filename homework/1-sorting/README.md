# Sorting
# Bogosort algorithm
## About this algorithm
The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.
## Usage on macOS
### Compile to machine code and run
```
swiftc Bogosort.swift -Ounchecked
./Bogosort
```
### Or just execute...
```
swift Bogosort.swift -Ounchecked
```
